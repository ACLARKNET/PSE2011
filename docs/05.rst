Lesson #5: zc.buildout variable reference syntax
================================================

Yet another major feature of zc.buildout is the ability to self-reference configuration parameter values. In other words, you can configure the value of one parameter with the value of another::

    [foo]
    bar = ${baz:bar}

    [baz]
    bar = quux

So the value foo:bar is quux.

Eggs
----

One of the most common examples of this feature in use is *instance:eggs*::


    [buildout]
    â€¦
    eggs = Plone

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}

Real work
---------

But enough about zc.buildout syntax and features! Now on to some real work.

Takeaway
--------

Yet another major zc.buildout feature is variable substitution.
