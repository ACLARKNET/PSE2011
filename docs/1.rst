Lesson #1: This documentation
=============================

A lot of "Plone Site Administration" i.e. "Getting your work done, so you can make a living and be happy" is about workflow. Humans generally like to feel comfortable with tasks they are responsible for in life, and the author is no exception.

Workflow
--------

* Doing what you like to do and knowing how to do it well
* Working on a team where your contributions are helpful and appreciated
* Knowing what to do when trouble arises

Tools
-----

* `Python`_
* `virtualenv`_
* `zc.buildout`_
* `Sphinx`_
* `Git`_

Process
-------

* Create development area
* Develop software and/or documentation
* Commit your changes
* Deploy the results

Details
-------

This documentation was created via the following commands::

    $ git clone git@github.com:ACLARKNET/PSE2011.git
    $ virtualenv PSE2011
    $ cd PSE2011
    $ bin/easy_install zc.buildout
    $ bin/buildout init

At this point, ``buildout.cfg`` was edited to look like this::

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/develop.cfg
    parts += sphinx

    [sphinx]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg

And then::

    $ bin/buildout
    $ bin/sphinx-quickstart
    $ cd docs

At this point a Sphinx project exists and we can add and edit documentation using reStructured text. The next thing to do is to commit changes::

    $ git add <files>
    $ git commit -a
    $ git push
