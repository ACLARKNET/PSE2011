Lesson #12: Installing c.r.backup
=================================

I.e. Add the ``backup`` section to the ``parts`` parameter of the ``buildout`` section, then add the ``backup`` section.

Installation
------------

In ../12.cfg we have::

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/zeo.cfg

Now run bin/buildout and restart Plone.

You'll notice we also added ZEO and some other things. We'll talk about that in the next section.
