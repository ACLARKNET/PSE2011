Lesson #13: ZEO
===============

In the previous example, we added some functionality to make backing up our site easier. In order to facilitate the operation of this new functionality, we added ZEO too.

Let's take a look at what adding ZEO entails.

Adding ZEO
----------

Here's the config again::

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/buildout.cfg
    parts += backup backups packups supervisor zeo 

    [plone]
    # To tell Plone to use zeo (overrides plone section in buildout.cfg)
    zeo-client = true
    shared-blob = on
    http-address = ${ports:plone}
    zeo-address = ${ports:zeo}

    [zeo]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver
    eggs = ${plone:eggs}
    zeo-address = ${ports:zeo}

    [supervisor]
    # To make it easy to run both bin/plone and bin/zeo
    recipe = collective.recipe.supervisor
    programs =
    # prio name proc parameters
        0 zeo ${buildout:directory}/bin/zeo [ fg ]
        0 plone ${buildout:directory}/bin/plone [ console ]
    port = ${ports:supervisor}
    serverurl = http://${hosts:localhost}:${ports:supervisor}

    [ports]
    supervisor = 9001
    plone = 8080
    zeo = 8100

    [hosts]
    localhost = 127.0.0.1

    [backup]
    recipe = collective.recipe.backup

    # Backup daily
    [backups]
    recipe = z3c.recipe.usercrontab
    times = 0 0 * * * 
    command = ${buildout:bin-directory}/bin/backup

    # Pack once a month
    [packups]
    recipe = z3c.recipe.usercrontab
    times = 0 0 1 * * 
    command = ${buildout:bin-directory}/bin/zeopack

And the important parts are::

    [buildout]
    …
    parts += … zeo 

    [plone]
    # To tell Plone to use zeo (overrides plone section in buildout.cfg)
    zeo-client = true
    shared-blob = on
    http-address = ${ports:plone}
    zeo-address = ${ports:zeo}

    [zeo]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver
    eggs = ${plone:eggs}
    zeo-address = ${ports:zeo}

Takeaway
--------

* Among other things, ZEO allows multi-client access to your database.
