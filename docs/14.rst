Lesson #14: Re-add add-ons
==========================

Since we've switched to using ZEO, let's now add back the sum of all our previous examples.

In ../14.cfg we have::

    [buildout]
    extends = 
        http://dist.aclark.net/build/plone/4.1.x/zeo.cfg 
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0rc1
    parts += sphinx

    [plone]
    eggs += 
        Products.PloneFormGen
        plone.app.dexterity
        plone.app.theming

    [sphinx]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg

So we now have a "production" setup plus add-ons: PFG, Dexterity, and Diazo (p.a.theming).

Takeaway
--------

* Configurations can be assembled in a variety of ways, do what is most comfortable for you.

* The installers provide easy access to both standalone and ZEO configurations.
