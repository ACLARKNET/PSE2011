Lesson #15: Bootstrapping
=========================

We've not yet discussed Python in any detail. Python is the foundation on top of which Plone is built. There are at least two distinct ways to install Plone on top of Python (not including the installers):

1. The first way:

  * Install Python
  * Install Distribute
  * easy_install zc.buildout
  * buildout init
  
  Now edit your buildout.cfg file, then:

  * buildout 
  * bin/plone fg

2. The other first way:

  * Install Python
  * Install Distribute
  * Install Virtualenv
  * virtualenv plone
  * cd plone
  * bin/easy_install zc.buildout
  * bin/buildout init
  
  Now edit your buildout.cfg file, then:

  * bin/buildout 
  * bin/plone fg

3. The second way:

  * git clone https://github.com/ACLARKNET/PSE2011
  * cd PSE2011
  * python2.6 bootstrap.py -d
  * bin/buildout
  * bin/plone fg

4. The other second way:

  * git clone https://github.com/ACLARKNET/PSE2011
  * virtualenv PSE2011
  * cd PSE2011
  * bin/python2.6 bootstrap.py -d
  * bin/buildout
  * bin/plone fg

Takeaway
--------

* There are many subtly different ways to accomplish the same thing. Either understand what you are doing, or use the installer.
