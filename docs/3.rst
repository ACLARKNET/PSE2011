Lesson #3: zc.buildout parts
============================

In the last lesson, we talked about zc.buildout *extends* which is a feature that allows you to span configuration across multiple files.

Another major feature of zc.buildout is it allows you to isolate project components into logical units called *parts*.

Each part is typically responsible for building a subset of your application.

Let's look again at the configuration file we are using to build Plone::

    [buildout]
    allow-hosts =
        *.plone.org
        *.python.org
    extensions = buildout.bootstrap
    extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.1b2/versions.cfg
    extends-cache = .
    versions = versions
    parts = plone
    find-links = http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/elementtree-1.2.7-20070827-preview.zip

    [plone]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    eggs =
        Pillow
        Plone
    zcml =

    [versions]
    distribute = 0.6.16
    zc.buildout = 1.5.2

Parts
-----

There is only one part! And that part is configured to use the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` recipe.

About parts
-----------

Parts are sections that require a ``recipe`` parameter.

* Another major feature of zc.buildout is the ability to separate build tasks into isolated sections called *parts*.

Sections and parameters
-----------------------

That's fine. But what are sections and parameters?
