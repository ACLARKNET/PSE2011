Lesson #6: Installing Plone 
===========================

There are several ways to install Plone. If you are new to Plone, the installer for your platform is the best way.

Buildout
--------

Let's take a look at how zc.buildout can be configured to install Plone::

    [buildout]
    allow-hosts =
        *.plone.org
        *.python.org
    extensions = buildout.bootstrap
    extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.1b2/versions.cfg
    extends-cache = .
    versions = versions
    parts = plone
    find-links = http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/elementtree-1.2.7-20070827-preview.zip

    [plone]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    eggs =
        Pillow
        Plone
    zcml =

    [versions]
    distribute = 0.6.16
    zc.buildout = 1.5.2

Important parts
---------------

The majority of functionality is configured via the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section::

    [plone]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    …
    eggs =
        …
        Plone
    …

Everything else is just details.
